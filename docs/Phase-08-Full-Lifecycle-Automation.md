### Phase 8: Full Lifecycle Automation (Optional) - Detailed Explanation

**Phase 8** is an optional phase aimed at automating the entire MLOps lifecycle for the fraud detection system, building on the robust A/B testing infrastructure established in Phases 5–7. By integrating **scheduled drift detection**, **MLflow**, **GitOps with ArgoCD**, and **Argo Rollouts**, this phase ensures continuous model retraining, deployment, and evaluation with minimal manual intervention. This automation addresses the manual overhead and error-prone processes seen in the stock prediction case (e.g., UUID mismatches, manual YAML updates), enabling a scalable, production-ready pipeline that maintains high performance and business value.

#### 1. Scheduled Drift Detection
- **Objective**: Automatically detect data drift in production transaction data to trigger model retraining, ensuring models remain relevant as fraud patterns evolve.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Drift Detection Tool**: Use a tool like Evidently AI or custom scripts to monitor feature distributions and prediction drift.
    - **Features Monitored**: Key transaction features (e.g., transaction amount, frequency, time-based features, ~50 features total).
    - **Metrics**: Statistical tests (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov for continuous features, chi-squared for categorical) to compare production data distributions against training data (Jan 2023–Mar 2024).
    - **Prediction Drift**: Monitor shifts in model outputs (e.g., fraud probability distributions) to detect changes in fraud behavior.
  - **Schedule**: Run drift detection daily via a Kubernetes CronJob:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: drift-detection
      namespace: seldon-system
    spec:
      schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
      jobTemplate:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: drift-detector
                image: custom/drift-detector:latest
                env:
                - name: DATA_SOURCE
                  value: "s3://mlflow-artifacts/processed/transactions/"
                - name: MODEL_NAME
                  value: "fraud_v2"
                - name: MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI
                  value: "http://mlflow.svc.cluster.local:5000"
              restartPolicy: OnFailure
    ```
  - **Trigger Logic**:
    - If drift is detected (e.g., p-value < 0.05 for significant feature shifts), trigger an Argo Workflow to retrain the model using the latest data.
    - Example drift report (logged to MLflow):
      ```json
      {
        "timestamp": "2025-07-21T02:00:00Z",
        "features_with_drift": ["transaction_amount", "frequency"],
        "p_values": {"transaction_amount": 0.01, "frequency": 0.03},
        "action": "trigger_retrain"
      }
      ```
  - **Integration**: Drift detection results are stored in MLflow as artifacts and triggerಸ

System: **Scheduled Drift Detection**:
  - Alerts are sent to a monitoring dashboard (e.g., Grafana) and trigger notifications to the team if significant drift is detected.
  - **Why It Works**: Automated drift detection ensures proactive model updates, avoiding performance degradation due to evolving fraud patterns, unlike the stock prediction case where data mismatches caused silent failures.

#### 2. MLflow for Experiment Tracking + Artifact Versioning
- **Objective**: Centralize experiment tracking and model artifact versioning to maintain traceability and reproducibility across the automated lifecycle.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Experiment Tracking**:
    - Each retraining run is logged as an MLflow experiment, capturing:
      - Training data details (e.g., date range, feature set).
      - Hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, layers).
      - Metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1 on validation set).
      - Model artifacts (e.g., TensorFlow `SavedModel`).
    - Example MLflow run:
      ```python
      with mlflow.start_run():
          model = train_model(data, params)
          mlflow.log_params(params)
          mlflow.log_metrics({"precision": 0.91, "recall": 0.85, "f1": 0.88})
          mlflow.tensorflow.log_model(model, "model", registered_model_name="fraud_v3")
      ```
  - **Artifact Versioning**:
    - Models are registered in the MLflow Model Registry with semantic versioning (e.g., `fraud_v3`, `fraud_v4`).
    - Artifacts are stored in S3/MinIO with unique paths (e.g., `s3://mlflow-artifacts/.../fraud_v3/`), abstracted by MLflow URIs (e.g., `models:/fraud_v3/Production`).
    - Automatic versioning ensures each retrained model is uniquely identified and linked to its training run.
  - **Automation**:
    - Retraining pipelines log new models automatically upon completion, triggered by drift detection.
    - Models are transitioned to the Staging stage for validation before A/B testing.
  - **Why It Works**: MLflow provides a centralized hub for tracking experiments and versioning models, eliminating the UUID chaos of the stock prediction case and enabling seamless integration with Seldon deployments.

#### 3. GitOps (ArgoCD) for Automatic Seldon Updates
- **Objective**: Automate SeldonDeployment updates using GitOps principles to ensure consistent, reproducible deployments.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Git Repository**: Store `SeldonDeployment` YAML files in a Git repository (e.g., `k8s/fraud-deployment.yaml`).
  - **ArgoCD Configuration**:
    - ArgoCD monitors the Git repository for changes and automatically applies updates to the Kubernetes cluster.
    - Example ArgoCD Application:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Application
      metadata:
        name: fraud-predictor
        namespace: argocd
      spec:
        project: default
        source:
          repoURL: https://github.com/fintech-corp/mlops-config.git
          targetRevision: main
          path: k8s
        destination:
          server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
          namespace: seldon-system
        syncPolicy:
          automated:
            prune: true
            selfHeal: true
      ```
  - **Workflow**:
    - Upon successful retraining and validation, a script updates the `SeldonDeployment` YAML in the Git repository to reflect the new model (e.g., `fraud_v3` with 100% traffic).
    - ArgoCD detects the change and applies it to the cluster, ensuring zero-downtime updates.
  - **Rollback Safety**:
    - Git history allows instant rollback to previous configurations if issues arise.
    - Example rollback command:
      ```bash
      git revert <commit_id>
      git push
      ```
  - **Why It Works**: GitOps eliminates manual YAML updates, reducing errors like those in the stock prediction case (e.g., fat-fingered UUIDs), and ensures consistent deployments aligned with model lifecycle changes.

#### 4. Argo Rollouts for Progressive Traffic Shifting
- **Objective**: Gradually shift traffic to new models during A/B testing or promotion to minimize risk and validate performance incrementally.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Argo Rollouts Configuration**:
    - Replace the `SeldonDeployment` with an Argo Rollout resource for progressive traffic shifting:
      ```yaml
      apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
      kind: Rollout
      metadata:
        name: fraud-predictor
        namespace: seldon-system
      spec:
        replicas: 2
        strategy:
          canary:
            steps:
            - setWeight: 10  # Start with 10% traffic to new model
            - pause: { duration: 3600 }  # Wait 1 hour
            - setWeight: 20  # Increase to 20%
            - pause: { duration: 3600 }
            - setWeight: 50  # Increase to 50%
            - pause: { duration: 3600 }
            - setWeight: 100 # Full traffic to new model
        selector:
          matchLabels:
            app: fraud-predictor
        template:
          spec:
            containers:
            - name: fraud-model
              image: tensorflow/serving:latest
              env:
              - name: MODEL_NAME
                value: fraud_v3
              - name: MODEL_URI
                value: models:/fraud_v3/Production
      ```
  - **Rollout Process**:
    - After drift detection triggers retraining, the new model (e.g., `fraud_v3`) is validated offline and deployed as a canary with 10% traffic.
    - Prometheus/Grafana monitors metrics (e.g., precision@production, recall@production, latency) at each step.
    - If metrics meet criteria (e.g., recall ≥0.85, precision ~0.91), traffic incrementally shifts to 100% over hours or days.
    - If issues arise (e.g., recall drop), Argo Rollouts automatically reverts to the previous model (e.g., `fraud_v2`).
  - **Analysis Integration**:
    - Argo Rollouts integrates with Prometheus for automated analysis:
      ```yaml
      analysis:
        templates:
        - templateName: performance-check
          metrics:
          - name: recall
            interval: 5m
            successCondition: result >= 0.85
            failureLimit: 3
            provider:
              prometheus:
                address: http://prometheus.svc.cluster.local:9090
                query: fraud_recall_production{model="fraud_v3"}
      ```
    - Failure to meet success conditions triggers an automatic rollback.
  - **Why It Works**: Progressive traffic shifting reduces risk compared to abrupt 80/20 A/B tests, ensuring stable performance and addressing the stock prediction case’s issue of deploying Westbrook

System: deploying low-value models without validation.

#### Why This Works for Seldon A/B Testing
Phase 8 enhances the Seldon A/B testing framework by automating the entire model lifecycle, making it ideal for demonstrating Seldon Core’s capabilities:
- **Continuous Improvement**: Scheduled drift detection ensures models stay relevant, unlike the stock prediction case where outdated data caused performance issues.
- **Error Reduction**: GitOps and MLflow eliminate manual configuration errors (e.g., UUID mismatches), ensuring reliable deployments.
- **Scalable Testing**: Argo Rollouts’ progressive traffic shifting allows safe, incremental A/B testing, minimizing risk compared to the abrupt traffic splits in the stock prediction case.
- **Business Alignment**: Automated validation and promotion focus on maintaining high recall (~0.85) and precision (~0.91), delivering clear business value (fraud loss reduction).
- **Traceability**: MLflow’s experiment tracking and lifecycle documentation provide full transparency, addressing the stock prediction case’s lack of governance.

This phase transforms the fraud detection system into a fully automated, production-grade MLOps pipeline, showcasing Seldon Core’s ability to support continuous model improvement, robust A/B testing, and business-driven outcomes.
