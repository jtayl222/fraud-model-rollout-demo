# Phase 9: CI/CD Automation

## Overview
This phase completes the MLOps lifecycle by adding full CI/CD automation, eliminating manual steps in the model development and deployment process.

## Goals
- Automate model training on code changes
- Automate container image building and registry push
- Automate Kubernetes deployment updates
- Add integration testing and validation
- Enable GitOps workflow for production deployments

## Implementation

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Structure

```
.github/workflows/
├── ml-pipeline.yml          # Main ML pipeline
├── build-push.yml          # Container build workflow
└── deploy-staging.yml      # Staging deployment
```

### 2. ML Pipeline Workflow

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branch
- Pull requests
- Manual dispatch with model version parameter

**Jobs:**
1. **Data Validation**
   - Check data availability
   - Validate data schema
   - Run data quality checks

2. **Model Training**
   - Train both baseline and candidate models
   - Register models in MLflow
   - Generate performance reports

3. **Model Testing**
   - Unit tests for preprocessing
   - Integration tests for model API
   - Performance regression tests

4. **Container Build**
   - Build MLServer container with model
   - Push to Harbor registry
   - Update Kubernetes manifests

5. **Deploy to Staging**
   - Apply Kubernetes manifests
   - Run smoke tests
   - Generate deployment report

### 3. Key Features

**Environment Management:**
- Separate configs for dev/staging/production
- Secret management via GitHub Secrets
- Environment-specific MLflow tracking

**Quality Gates:**
- Model performance thresholds
- Test coverage requirements
- Security scanning for containers

**Rollback Capability:**
- Automatic rollback on failed tests
- Manual approval for production
- Version pinning for stability

### 4. Integration Points

**MLflow:**
- Automatic experiment tracking
- Model registration with CI metadata
- Artifact storage in S3

**Harbor Registry:**
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Image signing for security
- Retention policies

**Kubernetes:**
- GitOps with Flux/ArgoCD
- Automated rollout strategies
- Canary deployments

### 5. Monitoring Integration

**Pipeline Metrics:**
- Build success rates
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery

**Notifications:**
- Slack/email alerts
- PR comments with results
- Dashboard updates

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Every model follows the same process
2. **Speed**: Minutes from commit to staging deployment
3. **Safety**: Automated testing catches issues early
4. **Auditability**: Complete history of all changes
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new models/experiments

## Next Steps

1. Implement GitHub Actions workflows
2. Add comprehensive test suite
3. Configure staging environment
4. Set up GitOps for production
5. Create runbooks for common scenarios

## Success Metrics

- 90% reduction in manual deployment steps
- < 30 minute commit-to-staging time
- Zero failed production deployments
- 100% model lineage tracking
- Automated rollback success rate > 95%
