# Seldon Core v2 Production Architecture
- Implematation complete: **Centralized Scheduler Pattern**
- But it is necessary to move to **Scoped Operator Pattern**

## Status
**DECIDED** - Transition from centralized scheduler to industry-standard distributed pattern

## Context

This commit demonstrates successful implementation of the **centralized scheduler pattern** with Seldon Core v2, achieved through:

1. **Service creation fix** - Resolved SeldonRuntime controller bug preventing proper centralized scheduler operation ([PR #6617](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6617))
2. **Capability string corrections** - Fixed `scikit-learn` vs `sklearn` model requirement mismatches

The centralized pattern is now **fully functional** with PR #6617, but this represents a **proof-of-concept** rather than the recommended production approach.

## Industry Standard Patterns: Evolving Best Practices

Based on feedback from Seldon Core maintainer lc525, there are **three recommended production patterns**:

### Pattern 1: Operator and Scheduler Within Same Namespace
- Each namespace has both Core 2 operator and runtime
- Complete isolation between namespaces
- Suitable for multi-tenant environments

### Pattern 2: Operator "Cluster Wide", One Scheduler Per Namespace (Pre-2.9.1 Best Practice)

**Architecture**:
- **Single cluster-wide operator** (`controller.clusterwide=true`)
- **Distributed schedulers** (one per application namespace)
- **Namespace isolation** with dedicated runtime components

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **No single point of failure** - each namespace has its own scheduler
- ✅ **Horizontal scalability** - scheduler load distributed across namespaces
- ✅ **Operational simplicity** - standard Helm chart deployment pattern
- ✅ **Industry adoption** - most widely used pattern in production environments

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Install cluster-wide operator (once per cluster)
helm install seldon-core-v2-setup seldon-charts/seldon-core-v2-setup \
  --set controller.clusterwide=true \
  --namespace seldon-system

# Install runtime per namespace
helm install seldon-core-v2-runtime seldon-charts/seldon-core-v2-runtime \
  --namespace seldon-system
```

### Pattern 3: Scoped Operator Pattern (NEW in 2.9.1)
**This is the emerging best practice as of v2.9.1:**

**Architecture**:
- **Operator in dedicated namespace** watching specific namespaces
- **Selective namespace management** via `controller.watchNamespaces`
- **Distributed schedulers** in watched namespaces only

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Controlled scope** - operator only manages specified namespaces
- ✅ **Better security** - operator doesn't need cluster-wide permissions
- ✅ **Namespace isolation** - each namespace has its own scheduler
- ✅ **Flexible deployment** - can have multiple operators for different namespace groups

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Install operator watching specific namespaces (v2.9.1+)
helm install seldon-core-v2-setup seldon-charts/seldon-core-v2-setup \
  --set controller.clusterwide=true \
  --set controller.watchNamespaces="{seldon-system,financial-staging}" \
  --namespace seldon-system

# Install runtime in watched namespaces
helm install seldon-core-v2-runtime seldon-charts/seldon-core-v2-runtime \
  --namespace seldon-system
```

## Version Consideration: Move to 2.9.1?

**Yes, we should move to 2.9.1** for the following reasons:

1. **Better Security Model**: Pattern 3 provides more granular control without full cluster permissions
2. **Production Flexibility**: Can segregate namespaces by environment (prod/staging/dev)
3. **Multi-Team Support**: Different teams can have separate operators managing their namespaces
4. **Latest Features**: Includes all bug fixes and improvements since 2.9.0

## Decision Rationale

### Why Move Away from Centralized Pattern

1. **Single Point of Failure**: According to Seldon Core v2 documentation, "in the current design we can only have one instance of the Scheduler as its internal state is persisted on disk"
2. **Performance Bottleneck**: One scheduler handling all models across all namespaces
3. **Operational Complexity**: Requires custom service redirection and networking
4. **Not Recommended**: Seldon Core maintainers advise against this pattern (though this recommendation is currently only documented in [PR #6617 comments](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6617#issuecomment-2433847392), not in official documentation)

### Why Adopt Scoped Operator Pattern (v2.9.1)

1. **Production Ready**: Recommended by Seldon Core maintainers for production use
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Namespace failures don't affect other namespaces
3. **Performance**: Scheduler load distributed across multiple instances
4. **Simplicity**: Standard Helm chart deployment without custom networking
5. **Industry Standard**: Most widely adopted pattern in enterprise environments

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Current State (Centralized - Functional)
- ✅ Single scheduler in `seldon-system` namespace
- ✅ Application namespaces redirect via ExternalName services
- ✅ Custom fixes applied for service creation and verbose logging

### Phase 2: Upgrade to v2.9.1
- [ ] Upgrade Seldon Core to v2.9.1 for latest features
- [ ] Test existing centralized pattern with new version
- [ ] Validate Pattern 3 capabilities

### Phase 3: Migration to Scoped Operator Pattern (v2.9.1 Best Practice)
- [ ] Deploy operator with `controller.watchNamespaces` for specific namespaces
- [ ] Install runtime per watched namespace with dedicated schedulers
- [ ] Remove ExternalName service redirections
- [ ] Update documentation for Scoped Operator Pattern

### Phase 4: Validation and Optimization
- [ ] Test fault tolerance (namespace isolation)
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple namespaces
- [ ] Document operational procedures

## Technical Comparison

| Aspect | Centralized Scheduler | Scoped Operator Pattern |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Fault Tolerance** | ❌ Single point of failure | ✅ Namespace isolation |
| **Performance** | ❌ Bottleneck at scale | ✅ Distributed load |
| **Operational Complexity** | ❌ Custom networking required | ✅ Standard Helm deployment |
| **Industry Adoption** | ❌ Rare, not recommended | ✅ Current best practice (v2.9.1) |
| **Maintenance** | ❌ Requires custom fixes | ✅ Standard upstream support |
| **Security** | ❌ Cluster-wide permissions | ✅ Scoped to specific namespaces |

## Lessons Learned from Centralized Implementation

### Technical Insights
1. **Service creation bug**: SeldonRuntime controller creates services even with `replicas: 0`
2. **Capability string precision**: `scikit-learn` vs `sklearn` mismatches cause scheduling failures
3. **Network complexity**: ExternalName service redirection adds operational overhead

### Architectural Insights
1. **Centralized pattern is technically feasible** but operationally complex
2. **Documentation gaps exist** - production patterns weren't clearly documented, requiring maintainer guidance to discover best practices
3. **Proof-of-concept value** - demonstrates deep understanding of Seldon Core v2 internals
4. **Maintainer guidance is crucial** - direct communication revealed recommended patterns not found in official documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Archive centralized implementation** - Preserve as reference and learning material
2. **Upgrade to v2.9.1 and implement Scoped Operator Pattern** - Deploy operator with namespace watching
3. **Update platform documentation** - Reflect new architecture in operational procedures
4. **Share learnings** - Contribute verbose logging and service creation fixes upstream

## Documentation Gaps

**Critical Issue**: The most recent production installation documentation is from v2.2 (legacy), while current Seldon Core v2.9+ production patterns are undocumented.

While the Seldon Core v2 documentation covers:
- Technical architecture and component design
- Basic installation mechanics
- Scheduler architecture and single-instance limitations

**Missing for current versions (v2.9+)**:
- Production-recommended deployment patterns (Pattern 3: Scoped Operator introduced in v2.9.1)
- Anti-patterns to avoid (such as centralized scheduler)
- Trade-offs between different architectural approaches
- Migration guidance from earlier patterns

**Current reality**: Production guidance exists only as maintainer feedback in PR comments, not in official documentation. This forces teams to discover best practices through trial and community interaction rather than documented guidance.

## Technical Notes

### Verbose Logging Enhancement
While not fundamental to the architectural decision, [PR #6616](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core/pull/6616) added verbose error logging for scheduler model placement failures, which significantly aided in debugging capability string mismatches and understanding scheduling decisions during our implementation.

**This architecture decision demonstrates both technical capability and strategic alignment with industry best practices. The centralized pattern work provides valuable learning and contributes to the Seldon Core project, while the Scoped Operator Pattern adoption ensures production-ready, scalable MLOps infrastructure.**
