Recommendation: **DO NOT PROMOTE CANDIDATE MODEL (v2) YET**
Reason: Candidate model did not meet the required performance criteria (e.g., <5% recall improvement or significant precision drop). Further investigation or retraining is needed before deployment.

Phase 4 Completed.
```

## next step:
```
Based on the Phase 4 outcome, where the Candidate Model (v2) was not recommended for promotion due to a significant precision drop despite perfect recall, here's some advice you can give to a college intern on how to move forward:

### Advice for Moving Forward: Addressing the Precision-Recall Trade-off

The recent evaluation of `fraud_v2` showed an incredible recall (100%), meaning it caught all fraudulent transactions! However, it also had a noticeable drop in precision. This means it's flagging more legitimate transactions as fraudulent (false positives). While catching all fraud sounds great, a high number of false positives can be problematic for the business (e.g., increased operational costs for investigation, negative customer experience).

Here are the next steps to investigate and improve the model:

#### **1. Revisit the Business Context of False Positives**

* **Understand the Cost:** Work with the product or business team to quantify the actual cost of a false positive versus a false negative (missing a fraud).
    * **False Positive Cost:** How much time/money does it cost to investigate a false alert? Does it annoy customers?
    * **False Negative Cost:** How much money is lost when fraud is missed?
* **Target Metrics:** Based on these costs, clarify the *acceptable trade-off* between precision and recall. Sometimes, a slight dip in precision is acceptable for a big gain in recall, but there's usually a limit.

#### **2. Adjust the Classification Threshold**

* **Explore Thresholds:** Our models currently use a default probability threshold of 0.5 to classify a transaction as fraud. You can adjust this threshold.
    * **Higher Threshold (>0.5):** This will make the model more "strict." It will likely reduce false positives (increase precision) but might also increase false negatives (decrease recall).
    * **Lower Threshold (<0.5):** This will make the model more "lenient." It will likely increase false positives (decrease precision) but might also decrease false negatives (increase recall).
* **Actionable Step:**
    * Using the `fraud_v2` model, generate probability predictions (`y_pred_probs_v2`) on the holdout set.
    * Experiment with different thresholds (e.g., 0.6, 0.7, 0.8) and recalculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each.
    * Visualize the **Precision-Recall Curve** for `fraud_v2`. This curve shows the trade-off between precision and recall at various thresholds. Find a point on the curve that balances both metrics according to business needs.

#### **3. Advanced Model Investigation & Retraining**

If threshold tuning isn't enough, consider deeper model investigation:

* **Error Analysis:** Look at the specific transactions that are being incorrectly classified as false positives by `fraud_v2`. Are there common characteristics (e.g., amount, time of day, specific features) among these false positives? This can give clues for feature engineering or model improvements.
* **Feature Importance:** Analyze which features `fraud_v2` is relying on most heavily for its predictions. Are these features behaving as expected for fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions?
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** While the architecture was kept identical to v1, you could try tuning hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of units per layer, dropout rates) for `fraud_v2` with a focus on improving precision while maintaining high recall. This would be a "new" `fraud_v2` iteration.
* **Consider Different Architectures (if necessary):** If repeated tuning doesn't work, this might be a longer-term task to explore slightly different model architectures (e.g., adding more layers, different activation functions) or even different model types, but this goes beyond the current scope of keeping the architecture consistent for A/B testing.

#### **4. Document Your Findings**

* Keep a clear record of your experiments with different thresholds and any insights from error analysis.
* Document the new metrics you achieve at different thresholds. This information is crucial for the "human analyst review" and the final "deployment decision gate."

By taking these steps, you can help refine the candidate model to meet both the technical performance requirements and the business objectives, ultimately moving closer to a successful A/B test deployment.
