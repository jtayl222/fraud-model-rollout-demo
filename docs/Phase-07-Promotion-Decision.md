# Phase 7: Model Promotion Decision

## Overview

After successfully deploying the fraud detection A/B test infrastructure and resolving the JSON format issues, we've collected initial performance data to evaluate whether the candidate model (v2) should be promoted to production.

## üîç Current A/B Test Configuration

- **Baseline Model (v1)**: 80% of traffic, 73% recall (from training)
- **Candidate Model (v2)**: 20% of traffic, 100% recall (from training)
- **Infrastructure**: Fully operational with V2 inference protocol

## üìä Initial Test Results

### Traffic Simulation Results (50 transactions, 10% fraud rate)

#### Model Performance
Both models showed identical behavior in the initial test:
- **Accuracy**: 90% (correctly identified all legitimate transactions)
- **Precision**: 0% (no fraud predictions made)
- **Recall**: 0% (missed all fraudulent transactions)
- **F1 Score**: 0.000

#### Response Times
- **Baseline (v1)**: Average 1546.9ms, 95th percentile 2111.0ms
- **Candidate (v2)**: Average 1414.0ms, 95th percentile 1900.2ms
- **Winner**: Candidate model is ~8.6% faster

#### Business Impact
- **Fraud Caught**: 0/5 transactions by both models
- **Estimated Loss**: $4,901.80 (all fraud went undetected)

## ü§î Analysis of Unexpected Results

### Why Both Models Predict 0.0?

1. **Conservative Threshold**: Models may be trained with imbalanced data leading to conservative predictions
2. **Feature Distribution**: Synthetic test data may not match training distribution
3. **Model Loading**: Both models might be loading the same weights (configuration issue)
4. **Prediction Threshold**: Default threshold of 0.5 may be too high for these models

### Infrastructure Validation ‚úÖ
- Models load successfully from S3
- V2 inference protocol working correctly
- Response times are reasonable
- No errors or failures in prediction pipeline

## üìà Recommendation: INVESTIGATE FURTHER

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Verify Model Differences**
   ```bash
   # Check if models have different weights
   kubectl exec -it mlserver-0 -c mlserver -- ls -la /mnt/agent/models/
   ```

2. **Test with Real Data**
   - Use actual fraud examples from training set
   - Verify predictions match expected recall rates

3. **Adjust Prediction Threshold**
   - Analyze prediction score distribution
   - Consider lowering threshold from 0.5 to optimize recall

4. **Extended Testing Period**
   - Run for 2-4 weeks with real traffic
   - Collect at least 10,000 transactions per model
   - Monitor for actual fraud detection differences

## üéØ Promotion Criteria Status

| Criteria | Target | Current | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Recall Improvement | ‚â• +5% | 0% | ‚ùå Not Met |
| Precision Maintained | ¬±1% | N/A | ‚ö†Ô∏è No Data |
| Latency | ‚â§ baseline + 10ms | -132.9ms | ‚úÖ Better |
| Error Rate | ‚â§ baseline | 0% | ‚úÖ Equal |
| System Stability | No issues | Stable | ‚úÖ Good |

## üö¶ Decision: DO NOT PROMOTE YET

### Rationale
1. **Insufficient Data**: Both models showing identical behavior suggests testing issue
2. **No Recall Improvement**: Cannot verify the expected +26.6% improvement
3. **Risk of Regression**: Promoting without performance validation is risky

### Next Steps

1. **Debug Model Predictions**
   - Verify models are actually different
   - Test with known fraud examples
   - Check prediction probability distributions

2. **Extend Testing Period**
   - Configure logging to capture prediction scores
   - Run with production traffic patterns
   - Monitor for model differentiation

3. **Threshold Optimization**
   - Analyze score distributions
   - Test different thresholds for optimal recall/precision balance

4. **Business Alignment**
   - Review fraud detection requirements
   - Confirm acceptable false positive rates
   - Define clear success metrics

## üìÖ Timeline

- **Week 1**: Debug and verify model differences
- **Weeks 2-5**: Extended A/B testing with production traffic
- **Week 6**: Final analysis and promotion decision

## üîß Technical Improvements Needed

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Log prediction probabilities (not just binary outcomes)
   - Track score distributions per model
   - Implement real-time model performance dashboards

2. **Testing Framework**
   - Create test sets with known fraud patterns
   - Implement automated performance validation
   - Build confidence intervals for metrics

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Document quick rollback procedure
   - Test traffic shifting capabilities
   - Ensure monitoring alerts are configured

## üìã Summary

While the infrastructure is working perfectly, the initial test results show both models behaving identically with zero fraud detection. This indicates either a testing issue or both models being extremely conservative.

**Recommendation**: Investigate the root cause before making any promotion decisions. The candidate model's improved training metrics (100% recall) need to be validated in the production environment before promotion.
