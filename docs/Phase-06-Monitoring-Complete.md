- **System Throughput**: 4.42 transactions/second sustained

## üîß Monitoring Infrastructure Details

### **Prometheus Integration**
```yaml
# Applied ConfigMaps:
- fraud-detection-prometheus (scrape config)
- fraud-detection-alerts (alert rules)

# Key Metrics Available:
- fraud_model_accuracy
- fraud_model_precision
- fraud_model_recall (key decision metric)
- fraud_traffic_weight
- fraud_detection_rate
- fraud_false_positive_rate
```

### **Alert Rules Configured**
```yaml
Critical Alerts:
- FraudModelDown: Seldon scheduler unavailable
- HighModelErrorRate: Error rate > 5%

Warning Alerts:
- SlowModelResponse: 95th percentile > 1s
- ABTrafficImbalance: Traffic split deviation > 15%
```

### **Metrics Collection Process**
```bash
# Automated collection via:
python scripts/push-fraud-metrics.py

# Real-time verification:
curl http://192.168.1.209:9091/metrics | grep fraud_model_recall
```

## üìà A/B Test Decision Framework

### **Current Performance Analysis (Confusion Matrix Results)**
The candidate model shows promising but limited results:

```
Decision Metrics Analysis:
‚úÖ Candidate model superior accuracy: 100% vs 97.59% baseline  
‚úÖ Perfect recall on candidate sample: 6/6 fraud cases detected (100%)
‚úÖ Precision maintained: Both models show 1.000 precision (no false positives)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Small sample limitation: Only 34 transactions for candidate (vs 166 baseline)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Overall system recall: 80% (4 fraud cases missed across all models)

CURRENT RECOMMENDATION: EXPAND TESTING
- Candidate model shows perfect performance on limited sample
- Need larger sample size for statistical significance
- Consider threshold optimization to improve overall recall from 80%
```

### **Statistical Significance (Updated Status)**
- **Sample Size**: 200 transactions completed (166 baseline, 34 candidate)
- **Baseline Performance**: 97.59% accuracy, 71.4% recall (10/14 fraud detected)
- **Candidate Performance**: 100% accuracy, 100% recall (6/6 fraud detected)
- **Statistical Limitation**: Candidate sample too small for definitive conclusions
- **Next Phase**: Scale to 1,000+ transactions per model for statistical power
