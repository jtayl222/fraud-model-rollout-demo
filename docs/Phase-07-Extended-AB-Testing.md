# Phase 7: Extended A/B Testing in Production

**Status**: ACTIVE - Extended A/B Testing Phase  
**Started**: July 22, 2025 at 00:55 UTC  
**Duration**: 4 weeks (28 days)  
**Expected Completion**: August 19, 2025

## Overview

The production fraud detection system is now running extended A/B testing with both models properly configured and validated. All infrastructure issues have been resolved, and the system is performing as expected.

## Key Achievements

### âœ… Infrastructure Resolution
- **JSON Format Issue**: RESOLVED - V2 inference protocol working perfectly
- **Feature Preprocessing**: RESOLVED - Proper scaling and feature ordering implemented
- **Model Predictions**: RESOLVED - Both models producing accurate predictions
- **Optimal Thresholds**: IMPLEMENTED - V1: 0.5, V2: 0.9

### âœ… Production Performance Validation
- **Baseline Model (v1)**: 100% accuracy on test cases
- **Candidate Model (v2)**: 100% accuracy on test cases  
- **Response Times**: <1.5s average latency
- **A/B Traffic Split**: 80/20 functioning correctly

## Current Test Configuration

### Traffic Distribution
- **Baseline (v1)**: 80% of production traffic
- **Candidate (v2)**: 20% of production traffic

### Success Criteria
- **Minimum Transactions**: 10,000 per model (statistical significance)
- **Required Recall Improvement**: â‰¥5% (candidate over baseline)
- **Maximum Precision Drop**: â‰¤10% (acceptable business trade-off)
- **Statistical Confidence**: â‰¥95%

### Expected Results
Based on offline validation and threshold optimization:
- **V1 Baseline**: 73.5% recall, 97.9% precision
- **V2 Candidate**: 100% recall, 95.9% precision (at 0.9 threshold)
- **Expected Improvement**: +36% recall, -2% precision

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Real-time Dashboards
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Fraud detection rates, response times, error rates
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Model performance comparison, traffic distribution
- **Alert Rules**: Response time >2s, error rate >1%, success rate <99%

### Key Metrics Being Tracked
1. **Model Performance**: Precision, recall, F1-score per model
2. **Business Impact**: False positive rates, fraud catch rates
3. **System Performance**: Latency, throughput, availability
4. **A/B Test Metrics**: Statistical significance, confidence intervals

## Timeline & Milestones

### Week 1 (July 22-29, 2025)
- **Goal**: Initial production validation and system stability
- **Target**: 2,500 transactions total (2,000 v1, 500 v2)
- **Focus**: Monitor for any unexpected issues

### Week 2 (July 29 - Aug 5, 2025)  
- **Goal**: Build statistical sample size
- **Target**: 5,000 transactions total (4,000 v1, 1,000 v2)
- **Focus**: Early performance trend analysis

### Week 3 (Aug 5-12, 2025)
- **Goal**: Approach minimum sample size
- **Target**: 7,500 transactions total (6,000 v1, 1,500 v2)
- **Focus**: Statistical significance testing

### Week 4 (Aug 12-19, 2025)
- **Goal**: Complete A/B test with full statistical power
- **Target**: 12,500+ transactions total (10,000+ v1, 2,500+ v2)
- **Focus**: Final promotion decision

## Production Infrastructure

### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Cluster**: 5 nodes, 36 CPUs total
- **Seldon Core v2**: Model serving and A/B routing
- **MLflow Integration**: Model artifact storage (S3)
- **Ingress**: nginx with fraud-detection.local routing

### Model Serving
- **Format**: V2 Inference Protocol (JSON)
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler fitted on training data
- **Feature Order**: V1-V28, Amount, Time (30 features total)
- **Response Format**: Fraud probability + classification

## Next Steps

### Week 1 Actions
1. Monitor system stability and performance
2. Validate metrics collection is working
3. Ensure A/B traffic split is accurate
4. Weekly performance review

### Decision Gate (Week 4)
1. **Statistical Analysis**: Confidence intervals, significance testing
2. **Business Impact**: Cost-benefit analysis of recall vs precision trade-off
3. **Production Readiness**: System performance and reliability validation
4. **Go/No-Go Decision**: Promote v2 to full production or continue with v1

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
- **Immediate**: Route 100% traffic to v1 baseline if issues detected
- **Detection**: Automated alerts for performance degradation
- **Recovery Time**: <5 minutes to full v1 baseline operation

### Success Indicators
- âœ… Both models responding correctly to all transaction types
- âœ… No infrastructure errors or timeouts
- âœ… Metrics collection functioning properly  
- âœ… A/B traffic routing working as expected
